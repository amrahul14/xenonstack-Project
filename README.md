# Blogging Website Readme

## Project Overview

This is a full-stack blogging website that allows users to create and share their memories through public blog posts. The project is developed using Express.js and Node.js for the backend, MongoDB as the database system, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication and authorization.

## Features

- **Blog Post Creation:** Registered users can create, edit, and delete their blog posts. Each post is associated with the respective user.

- **Data Storage:** MongoDB is integrated as the database system, providing a scalable structure for storing blog posts and user information.

## Technologies Used
